# Containerised Threat Modelling Tool on AWS ECS Fargate

## Overview

This project deploys a containerised Threat Composer application on **AWS ECS Fargate** using **Terraform**, with the deployment fully automated through **GitHub Actions**.

The setup was created to **automate the deployment** of the threat modelling tool, eliminating the need to manually create AWS resources by leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform â€” just like it would be in a real-world production environment!
