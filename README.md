# Containerised Threat Modelling Tool on AWS ECS Fargate

## Overview

This project deploys a containerised Threat Composer application on **AWS ECS Fargate** using **Terraform**, with the deployment fully automated through **GitHub Actions**.

The setup was created to **automate the deployment** of the threat modelling tool, eliminating the need to manually create AWS resources by leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform â€” just like it would be in a real-world production environment!

## Features

- Fully automated infrastructure using **Terraform**
- Docker container pushed to **Amazon ECR**
- **ECS Fargate** service behind an **ALB** with **HTTPS**
- SSL certificate issued via **ACM** and validated through **Route 53**
- **GitHub Actions** workflows for:
  - Docker image build & push
  - Terraform plan, apply, and destroy
